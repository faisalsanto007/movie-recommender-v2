# movie-recommender-v2

I used the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata ). there are 2 csv files in the zip file. one of them is over 25 mb that's why couldn't upload it in the project folder. 

This project was quite fun. I took help from several sites, Medium, towards data science, kaggle to complete this project. Thanks to these websites. Finally, this recommender version performed better than the previous version. I've used 2 methods of filtering for recommending movies, demographic and content based filtering. tried to implement collaborative filtering but it was a bit difficult.

collaborative filtering is much more popular nowadays but creating a model based on collaborative filtering was challenging. I'll probably try making one in the future.
